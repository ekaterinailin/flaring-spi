# Flaring Star-Planet Interactions in Kepler and TESS Data

This repository contains the statistical analysis modules, and scripts to produce the figures and tables in the two following works:

1. [Ilin, E. and Poppenh√§ger K., (2022). *Searching for flaring star-planet interactions in AU Mic TESS observations.*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.4579I/abstract)
2. [Ilin, E. et al. (2024) *Planetary perturbers: Flaring star-planet interactions in Kepler and TESS*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.527.3395I/abstract)

The first introduces the statistical method used in the second, and demonstrates it on the popular case of AU Mic.

#### How to navigate this repository

**Nomenclature:**

- File names that contain `AU_Mic` are from project 1. 
- File names that begin with `_` belong to project 2.

**Folders:**

- `notebooks/` contains all the notebooks and scripts 
  - also contains the modules used in both, stored in `funcs/`
- `data/` contains ancillary data, such as the TESS transmission curve
- `results/` contain the flare table, the results of the A-D tests

## Project 1: Searching for flaring star-planet interactions in AU Mic TESS observations

Notebooks that produce the figures and tables in the paper found in `notebooks/`:

- `AU_Mic_flare_catalog_with_phases_TABLE1.ipynb`
  - example script of how to use the de-trending and flare finding described in Methods: `notebooks/findflares.py`
  - flaring finding method described in 2.1: `notebooks/funs/detrend.py`
  - electronic table of all flares: `results/2021_12_AU_Mic_2021_12_AU_Mic_final_flare_table.csv`
- `AU_Mic_AD_test_analysis_TABLE2.ipynb`
  - all A-D tests: `results/adtests.csv` (time stamped within the table) 
- `AU_Mic_illustrate_flares_FIGURE1.ipynb`
- `AU_Mic_FFD_FIGURE2.ipynb`
- `AU_Mic_cumdist_plot_FIGURE3.ipynb`
- `AU_Mic_illustrate_observability_FIGURE4.ipynb`

Look into A-D tests with doubled and tripled sample: `AU_Mic_AD_test_doubled_sample_DISCUSSION.ipynb`

## Project 2: Searching for flaring star-planet interactions in Kepler and TESS observations

`notebooks/`

01a and 01b -- sample selection
02 -- flare finding
02b -- take a closer look at Kepler-411 that actually is two flaring stars
03 -- vetting notebook, validating the completeness of the vetted table (did I look at all the flares and assigned false positives?)
04 -- write out the flare table to csv, paper-ready
05 -- notebook to make some nice flare plots
06 -- Anderson-Darling tests in various sub-samples
07 -- stellar and planetary parameters
08 -- coherence time scales of obrit and rotation
09 -- compiling the results in one giant table, incl. calculation of power of magnetic star-planet interaction
10 -- estimating tidal star-planet interaction
11 -- estimating the size of the Alfven radius
12 -- calculate the error on orbital phase of the flares as per reviewer request
